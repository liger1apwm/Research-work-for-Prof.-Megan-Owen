# Research-work-for-Prof.-Megan-Owen
This is some code I have done in Python while I have been working for Prof. Megan Owen on her research analyzing phylogenetic trees.

in here you can see some code we have build together with Aaron medero for the research to analyze data and look for bias. A lot of this codes 
consist in going through 32500 files to fix errors and doing csv's to later create graphs and test that tell us more information about the data.
The work is still not public but this a piece of the code we have worked so far.
